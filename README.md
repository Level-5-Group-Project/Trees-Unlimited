# Trees-Unlimited Notes for Team

Description:

The owner of Trees Unlimited would like to expand his internet exposure in his local town by showcasing
his products through a website. We will create a responsive web application for the local tree farm looking
to expand their business by displaying their companies inventory list, making available to the public the
services offered by the company, and lastly a section describing the company’s mission and presence in
the community.

MVP:

The team projects to have a presentable MVP to the client by Monday, May 2nd. This will compose of a
Home page, a Services page, and an About page, all displaying the products and services offered by the
company.

User Story:

Upon landing on the homepage, the user will be able to navigate through the three main sections of the
website using the navigation bar that is nested within the header of each page. The first being the Home
page, will render multiple card components containing the current list of the company’s inventory they
have at that time. The services page also renders the current list of services that they have to offer like
delivery options and land surveying estimates. Finally, the about page will be a nice displayed body of
the company’s information and contact information. The above features are what the client needs. The
optional features would consist of advanced filtering options allowing users to see specific types of trees
based on their desired search criteria. Also, another feature that would be helpful for the business would
be a form that allows users to input and submit feedback/questions or concerns that they have for the
company.
